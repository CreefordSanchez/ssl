          <h3>
            What is SSL?
          </h3>
          <p>
            SSL stands for Secure Sockets Layer, and it is used to secure 
            internet connections by encrypting the data exchanged between the 
            client and the server. This encryption helps to prevent
            hackers from seeing, stealing, or altering the data during 
            transmission, ensuring privacy and data integrity.
          </p>

          <h3>
            What is TLS?
          </h3>
          <p>
            TLS stands for Transport Layer Security. TLS provides the same 
            functions as SSL but offers more improved security and efficiency 
            compared to SSL. It's is used to encrypt data exchanged between a 
            clients browser and a server, ensuring secure internet connections.
          </p>

          <h3>
            What is encryption and why do I care?
          </h3>
          <p>
            Encryption is a process of converting your data or information 
            into a code using algorithms to transform it into an unreadable 
            format. This prevents hackers from reading your 
            personal information or data.
          </p>

          <h3>
            What does it mean to be secure?
          </h3>
          <p>
            Being secure means that measures are in place to protect against 
            threats and vulnerabilities. In the context it means that your 
            information wont be leaked, youre interacting with the legitimate 
            website, and data exchanges wont be tampered with.
          </p>

          <h3>
            How can I tell that my webpage is secure?
          </h3>
          <p>
            A locked padlock icon in the address bar of your browser means the 
            connection is secured with encryption. If it appears unlocked, 
            your connection is not secure.
          </p>

          <h3>
            Do the prefixes HTTP or HTTPS matter when 
            we're talking about secure websites?
          </h3>
          <p>
            A secure website URL should begin with "https" rather than "http" 
            as it uses encryption, while an HTTP URL does not use encryption.
          </p>

          <h3>
            What is an SSL certificate authority?
          </h3>
          <p>
            SSL certificate authority (CA) is a trusted entity that issues and
             verifies SSL/TLS certificates, which are used to encrypt and secure
              communications between websites and users.
